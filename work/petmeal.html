				<h2>About PetMeal</h2>

				<p>PetMeal is a homemade pet food reciepe delivery service, it makes it simple to serve the food
					your pet likes everyday. With this app, youâ€™ll
					discover different recipes, cooking techniques and how-to videos, as well as easily manage
					your account on-the-go.
					You can place an order of the reciepe to be delivered to your home from your prefered pet
					shop.
				</p>

				<h2>Diving deep into the challenge</h2>

				<p>All the commercially available pet food products in the stores and online have a lot of
					chemicals, artificial colors, preservatives,
					flavor enhancers and a lot of bad fats that makes the food more tasty and unhealthy to our
					pets. Usually, we buy some cheap
					unhealthy processed food for our pets. That food often contains wastes from food industries
					or some leftovers from dead
					animal carcasses.</p>

						<figcaption>Mom... that food was bad.</figcaption>
					</figure>
				</aside>
				<p>The pet food was good back some 3 decades ago, but since the boom of the processed food, both
					humans and pet food have some big
					degenerative health problems. Visiting the vet have increased in recent times due to a lot
					of unknown diseases in our
					pets health due to poor diet.</p>

				<p>Unlike human food, the pet's food doesn't go through extensive research to see if the product
					is keeping the pets healthy
					over a long period. There are no proper regulations in place to check it.</p>
				<p>Homemade diet for a pet is not a simple thing. It has to meet al the pet's nutritional
					requirements. One has to do a lot of research
					for recipes that fit both the owner and the pet's needs and lifestyle.</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p> The healthiest choice for a pet is a balanced homemade diet.</p>
				</blockquote>

				<h2>Research</h2>
				<p>The first step of the design process involved talking to pet owners.</p>

				<h3>User Interview</h3>
				<p>I had a few conversations with my friends and colleagues who have a pet. The purpose was to
					determine the basic â€˜pain-pointsâ€™ of pet owners when it comes to
					preparing a homemade diet. Learning about the problems of potential users is a great way to
					be inspired and motivated.
					Working with real-world data is a good starting point to help avoid guesswork and
					preconceptions. Using this
					information provided a better chance to discover the root of the problem and how to solve
					it.</p>
				<br />
				<p>Some of the questions were:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>How often do you make food for your pet?</li>
					<li>What motivated you to start feeding homemade food for your pet?</li>
					<li>How do you prepare homemade food?</li>
					<li>What are your challenges when it comes to preparing a balanced homemade food?</li>
					<li>How much time do you invest in preparing the food for your pet?</li>
					<li>How often do you search for recipes for healthy food online?</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>Direct quotes from the users:</h4>

							src="../content/1-work/3-petmeal/3-quotes.png">
						</source>
						</source>
					</picture>
				</figure>

				<h4>User Insights:</h4>
				<p>
					After analyzing the interviews, despite the amount of generated data, this was the most
					relevant information for decision-making in creating the solution.</p>

				<div class="full-width-white">
					<figure class="figure-wide wrapper-full">
						<picture>
							<source data-srcset="../content/1-work/3-petmeal/4-insights.png" type="image/png">

							</source>
							</source>
						</picture>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<p>From the data, it was clear that the pet owners want to serve homemade food to their pets but
					don't know what's
					healthy or how much should be served.</p>


				<h3>Competitor Research </h3>
				<p>In addition, I researched online about other similar products. Since there was no app serving
					a similar purpose, I took meal recipe kit delivery apps for inspiration. The goal was to
					understand how competitors behave and benchmark
					innovative ideas. I looked into apps such as Sun Basket, Blue Apron, Home Chef and studied
					how they provide their services.</p>

				<h4>What is the value? </h4>
				<p>Instead of focusing on what the users want, I ask myself why they need this app. What are the
					jobs to be done? By understanding why people
					might want this app it increased my chances of making a truly valuable product.</p>

				<h2>Ideate</h2>
				<p>I have a vague idea of how the app would function, but I need to refine the idea and make the
					user flow right.</p>
				<h3>User Flow</h3>
				<p>The main point of the flow is to ensure that the functionality is always visible to the user,
					but not in an obstructive way. The onboarding process gets information about the pet in a
					funny way and gives the recipes immediately. No account needed to see these. But in order to
					make a purchase, one needs to create an account and add their payment method.
				</p>

				</div>


				<h3>Paper Sketches</h3>

				<p>
					This was the first step to help me outline the app and visually imagine it.
				</p>

							</source>
							</source>
						</picture>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<h3>Wireframes</h3>
				<p>
					This visual guide represents the skeletal framework of the app. It helped me arrange the
					interface elements while I focused on the functionality rather than what it looks like.
					Moreover, the simplicity of wireframes allows me to quickly test ideas without diving into
					the details. </p>

				<h2>User Interface</h2>
				<p></p>
				<h3>Onboarding</h3>
				<p>The goal of the onboarding flow in Petmeal is to collect information about the userâ€™s pet to
					truly make it tailored to their needs. The critical part was to have the user answer five
					questions without getting discouraged and turn off the app. It required a simple and quick
					process.
					Numbering the questions, big sliding cards and a progression bar were some of the solutions
					I used to ease the process.</p>

						</picture>
					</figure>
				</div>
				<h3>Making a meal</h3>
				<p>This element is the heart of the app. After onboarding, users receive a recipe tailored to
					their petâ€™s needs. When viewing the recipe, one can see a list of ingredients,
					three simple steps explaining how to prepare the meal, and how much it costs.</p>

				<h3>Buy the recipe with ingredients</h3>
				<p>For extra convenience I decided to offer users an option to obtain all the necessary
					ingredients. Therefore, the next challenge was to create a process
					that consisted of a shopping list and
					deliver it to their front door. This procedure should be
					easy and quick to keep it in line with the appâ€™s easy interface.

				<h2>Design System</h2>
				<h3>Colors</h3>
				<p>I picked a playful and inviting tone, so I chose green as the primary color and yellow as a
					secondary.</p>
				<p>For text, dark black was used to contrast the white background. This is to ensure reading and
					contrast, thus reaching appropriate levels of accessibility.</p>

				<h3>Typography</h3>
				<p>I used the native iOS font SF Pro. The font is available for free use and works well with
					white layers.</p>

				<h2>Validation</h2>
				<p>I found that people would like to know where the meat is being delivered from and would like
					to see a choice to choose from multiple providers.
					The user's tab was a little confusing to some as they did not create an account at the
					being. The idea behind it was to go back and customize
					the pet information. Changing the icon to a pet could convey the message.
					The next steps are to incorporate the feedback into the design and do another round of
					testing before finalizing.</p>

				<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
				<p>Pet food is a $75 billion industry that produces foods that by and large are not the
					healthiest dietary choice
					for dogs and cats and may even harm the health and longevity of our furry friends. However,
					in the hectic daily lives,
					most of us lead, the convenience of using dry foods understandably wins over.</p>
				<p>The goal of this free mobile application is to allow users to quickly and easily make
					healthier food for their
					beloved pets at comparable costs to premium packaged foods. PetMeal is designed to help pet
					owners prepare homemade
					food for their furry friends. The app provides a daily feeding plan for each individual pet
					based on their
					nutritional needs. The app also tailors the food quantity and can deliver the products from
					local stores.
				</p>
				<p>It is my hope that this app will be supported by a pet food producer or marketer, with the
					understanding that
					providing pet owners with additional and healthier choices is social, canine and felinely, a
					more
					responsible way to conduct business.
